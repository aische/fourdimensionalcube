interactive 4-dimensional hyper cube


Reading "Cybernetics of Epistemology" by cyberneticist Heinz Von Foerster made me curious how it feels to control a hypercube, so I wrote this interactive animation. The first version was written in flash but does not work on most devices anymore, so I ported it to javascript. 

Heinz von FÃ¶rsters "radical constructivism" is based on the idea that our reality is not a direct mapping from the outside world into our consciousness, but is is constructed from invariants of the relation between our motions and our perceptions. To support this idea, he made an experiment with a hypercube and investigated how quickly people would learn to understand the movements of the cube. The expectable outcome was that people who could control the cube would learn much faster to predict the movements than people who could only watch it.

You will see two cubes, and if you manage to cross your eyes to watch each cube with one eye, you'll get a three-dimensional impression of the cube. This three-dimensional cube is a mapping from a four-dimensional hypercube to three dimensions. So the image is not four-dimensional, but the movements of the cube follow the rules of a four-dimensional space, so you might get an understanding of how things could behave in four dimensions. 

It's just one html-file (src/index.html) with some javascript, you can download the file and open it with your browser. Online-version is [here](http://dvde.biz/fourdimensionalcube/).
